# Battleship

## Description

This program is incomplete. It was constructed by following the tests of the file battleship_test.rb. It's goal is to design a working program that allows human players to compete with computer players in a game of Battleship. The program allows human players to enter coordinates to place their ships, while randomly generating computer ship placements. The program also accepts human player attempts to fire at computer ships, while generating random computer attempts to fire on human ships. The program would terminate once either player's ships are all sunk.
